            <div class="descriptiontext">
                <p>
                Street vending has been an important part of cities and their economy for a long time all around the world. It not only provides working opportunities for vendors but also increases merchant selection for consumers. However, the impression of street vendors is not always positive, some people view them as disruptors of city order because of their uncleanness and mobility. Vendors are facing various difficulties and pressures from society and City authorities. Many of them are immigrants who cannot speak English fluently while their whole family is depending on this low-income business on the street. Robbery, harassment, and police enforcement are also common for street vendors. In New York City, the process of becoming a vendor consumes highly on time and money.
                </p>

                <p>
                There are many difficulties that street vendors are facing, especially during the pandemic of COVID-19. License, high cost, low income, strict regulation, and police enforcement have already been stressing vendors out, with the pandemic and the widespread of delivery service, street vendors are losing consumers and the source to support their families.
                </p>

                <p>
                The LocoRoco vending project was inspired by the video game Loco Roco, which small dots gather to become bigger dots to defeat enemies, and break into small individual dots when necessary. The project aims to help vendors achieve solidarity by setting up a platform for individuals to help each other by exchanging opinions, providing delivery service, and sharing resources.
                </p>

                <p>
                The project develops two major parts, a physical kit, and a virtual platform for community. The physical kit consists of portable WIFI service and operable panels for vendor's meeting space construction. This kit aims to create internal connections among vendors by allowing them to assemble meetings and form spaces together whenever is needed. The mobile app features in vendor mapping and delivery service for vendors and consumers, and a platform for vendors and restaurant owners to cooperate.

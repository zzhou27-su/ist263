        Hello, welcome to my portfolio, my name is Ziyan Zhou, and I am a fifth-year architecture student at Syracuse University. I am interested in parametric design and urban planning, and Iâ€™d like to explore and how new digital inventions and tools can be applied to architectural design in the future to create different immersive experiences for visitors. I am skilled in using design, model-building, and drawing software like Adobe Suite, Rhino, Sketchup, AutoCAD, Revit, and Twinmotion. I am also able to build physical models precisely and am familiar with research resources like ArcGIS. My native language is Mandarin, but I can also speak English and Spanish. When I am out of work, I enjoy reading and listening to music. Cats are my favorite animal, I love spending time with my cats. I also enjoy learning new things, during the pandemic, I started teaching myself how to play the electric guitar and edit videos. This portfolio presents my works in different fields for your review. Thank you for checking it out and have a nice day!
